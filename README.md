# VocabularyTraining
Simple vocabulary Trainer written in Swift

This Vocabulary Trainer is using the basic principle of learning with flash cards. You can create as many languages as you like and write words and their translation.

In contrast to similar flash card apps, this one is pretty fast to use. Because you do not have to type in the word if you do not want to. You can just check "correct" or "incorrect".

# How to contribute

The app is kind of spaghetti code because it was my first released app and unfortunately it uses storyboards.

However, if you like to contribute, feel free :)

# App Store

If you do not want to build the app yourself, you can download it directly from the app store:
